If you were a robot you'd be optimus fiiiiine
I hope you like cheesy pickup lines, because if you were a fruit, you'd be a fiiineapple!
... and if you were a vegetable, I'd totally visit you in hospital as much as they'd allow me to.
If you were a triangle, you'd be acute one
if I had 4 quarters to give to the prettiest girls in the world, you'd have a whole dollar.
Sometimes I question why God allows bad things to happen to good people. For example, how have we never gone on a date?
